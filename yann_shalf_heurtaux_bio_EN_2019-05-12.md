Yann “shalf” Heurtaux, born 1980 in Brittany and raised in Toulouse, France, started working with online gaming communities as a volunteer Community Coordinator (aka “Guild Officer”) in the late 90’s, and first tasted the waters of the Web industry and the coworking movement in Brussels, Belgium, in 2011.
Yann is now a freelance Conversationalist in Lausanne, Switzerland, who helps organizations to engage stakeholders and communities in a better way, both on- and off-line.

Yann is the co-founder of Hackuarium, a biohacking community, BSL-1 registered biology lab, and association in the West Lausanne area, focusing on do-it-together, arts, and civic science projects (established in Renens, VD, in 2014, now in Écublens, VD).

In 2015-2016, Yann served as a Board Member for opendata.ch & coworking.ch, and co-founded VillageOffice.

From January 2017 to December 2018, Yann was a founding member and Lead Concierge for La Serre, a coworking community in Lausanne (Fourmi neighborhood).

Yann just started dansladreche.org, a circular effort around spent grains ("drêches" in French) for Lausanne’s urban craft beer breweries, with love and support from Zone-AH!’s ZéBU veterans in Paris, France.
